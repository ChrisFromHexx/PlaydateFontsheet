# Fontsheet for Playdate

Generate Playdate compatible font files (.fnt) from your imported **Font Book** files.

Use as the basis for creating your own unique custom PlayDate fonts.

Because **fontsheet** is converting smooth high resolution vector fonts into low res monochrome bitmaps some fettling[^1] with a tool like **Caps** (https://play.date/caps/) will be required to tune the font files to best meet your needs.


## Usage

**fontsheet**

The core parameters
```
./fontsheet ./sample/glyphs.txt -o ./fontFolder -f  MyTTFFont -s 20 -n MyPlaydateFont

```

|  |   |
|:---:|:---|
|  glyphs.txt |This is a file containing a single glyph per line. It feeds **fontsheet** the glyphs symbols to be included in the generated font file. ```space``` is a special keyword in indicate the glyph forâ€¦ a space.|
| ```--output``` *or* ```-o```  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | The folder to save the new Playdate font files
| ```--font``` *or* ```-f``` | The name of a font to convert that is installed in the Font Book app. The *Postscript Name* in the **Font Book** information panel is usally the best choice for the name value.
| ```--size``` *or* ```-s``` | The point size to render.
| ```--name``` *or* ```-n```  | The save name for the font.

Including the ```--embedded``` flag will create a self contained .fnt file that includes font pixel data embedded inside the file. A sample-*.png file is created as a visual reference but can be deleted without affecting the .fnt file.

For more options read ```./fontsheet --help```
